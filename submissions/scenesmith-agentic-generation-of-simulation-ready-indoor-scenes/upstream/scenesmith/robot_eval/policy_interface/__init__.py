"""Policy interface module for robot evaluation.

Provides interfaces for policies that need structured goals rather than
natural language task descriptions.

This module is OPTIONAL - the core gen+eval system is text-based.
These interfaces exist for policies that cannot interpret natural language.

The unified PolicyInterfaceAgent handles the entire pipeline:
1. Parses task → goal predicates + preconditions
2. Finds objects matching categories in scene
3. Verifies preconditions using state/vision tools
4. Returns ranked valid (target, reference) bindings
5. Computes exact poses for each binding (via PredicateResolver)
